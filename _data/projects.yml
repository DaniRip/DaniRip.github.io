  category: "fun"
  description: "Back in 2012, when I was still in Mechanical Engineering, Yuhin Wu, Ryan Brown, Keith Tong and I spent many a late night at Skule\u2122 building ART: the automated recycling terminal. ART was an Arduino-based recycling sorter for ASME's SEC competition (and we won the local competition!). We were also very young."
