  category: "fun"
  description: "Back in 2012, when I was still in Mechanical Engineering, Yuhin Wu, Ryan Brown, Keith Tong and I spent many a late night at Skule\u2122 building ART: the automated recycling terminal. ART was an Arduino-based recycling sorter for ASME's SEC competition (and we won the local competition!). We were also very young."

  category: "future"
  description: "With the current advent of AI and advanced OR techniques, I believe humanity is about to become a lot more transparent. I am interested in studying less invasive, more informative imaging protocols that we have the technology for now, not decades from now. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or to know more!"
