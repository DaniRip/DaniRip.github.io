  category: "fun"
  description: "Back in 2012, when I was still in Mechanical Engineering, Yuhin Wu, Ryan Brown, Keith Tong and I spent many a late night at Skule\u2122 building ART: the automated recycling terminal. ART was an Arduino-based recycling sorter for ASME's SEC competition (and we won the local competition!). We were also very young."

- title: "Combined Imaging Modalities"
  category: "future"
  description: "I am passionate about imaging and feel like people are much more transparent than we think. With the current advent of AI and advanced OR techniques, I hope to push for less invasive, more informative imaging protocols in the future. Please contact me if you would like to get started on this type of project!"
