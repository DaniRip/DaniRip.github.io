### Current Role:<br><a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/people/danielle-ripsman/" target="_blank">Malone Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>

I work under <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/" target="_blank">Dr. Kimia Ghobadi</a> with affiliations across the <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)</a>, the <a href="https://hbhi.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Hopkins Business of Health Initiative (HBHI)</a> and the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a>.

I received my Ph.D. in Management Science at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/" target="_blank">Department of Management Sciences and Engineering</a> under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/h6mahmou" target="_blank">Dr. Houra Mahmoudzadeh</a> in 2024. I previously received my M.A.Sc. under the same department and supervision in 2018. My B.A.Sc. was obtained at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a> in <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering</a> in 2016.

My research interests lie in tackling large-scale, data-driven societal problems, particularly in the field of healthcare.  My toolbox includes linear and mixed integer optimization, heuristics and efficient algorithms. The goal of my work is bringing these solutions back out of theory to the end users and decision-makers. My primary application area has historically been radiation therapy treatment planning for cancer patients. 
<!-- I have had the pleasure of working at the <a href="https://www.wrhn.ca/" target="_blank">Waterloo Regional Health Network (WRHN)</a> Cancer Centre, under the supervision of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/contacts/ernest-osei" target="_blank">Dr. Ernest Osei</a>, where we were able to work on pipelines to integrate optimization solutions into real-world radiation therapy-planning tools. -->
Whether it relates to public health, individual systems or fundamental algorithmic math, my emphasis is always on communication, illustration and teaching for the broader community.
