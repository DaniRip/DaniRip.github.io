<!-- ### Current Role:-->
## <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/people/danielle-ripsman/" target="_blank">Malone Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>

I work under <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/" target="_blank">Dr. Kimia Ghobadi</a>, researching at the intersection of **large-scale optimization** and **healthcare engineering**.

I obtained my Ph.D. (2024) and M.A.Sc. (2018) in Management Science at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/" target="_blank">Department of Management Sciences and Engineering</a> under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/h6mahmou" target="_blank">Dr. Houra Mahmoudzadeh</a>. My B.A.Sc. (2016) was earned at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a> in <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering</a>, where I was introduced to research in <a href="https://morlab.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">morLAB</a>. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Rotman School of Management</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>, under <a href="https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/16076-andre-augusto-cire" target="_blank">Dr. Andre Cire</a> and <a href="https://schulich.yorku.ca/faculty/adam-diamant/" target="_blank">Dr. Adam Diamant</a>.

My affiliations are across the <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)</a>, the <a href="https://hbhi.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Hopkins Business of Health Initiative (HBHI)</a> and the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a>. 

My research focuses on tackling **large-scale, data-driven societal problems**, particularly within **healthcare systems**. By leveraging a toolbox of **linear and mixed-integer optimization**, **inverse optimization**, and **decision diagrams**, I develop efficient heuristics and algorithms designed for **real-world** implementation. With a background in interface design, my goal is to translate complex theoretical solutions into accessible, actionable tools for decision-makers and the community at large.

Whether exploring public health systems or fundamental algorithmic mathematics, I am driven by a commitment to clear communication, illustration, and teaching. 

<!-- My primary application area has historically been radiation therapy treatment planning for cancer patients.  I have had the pleasure of working at the <a href="https://www.wrhn.ca/" target="_blank">Waterloo Regional Health Network (WRHN)</a> Cancer Centre, under the supervision of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/contacts/ernest-osei" target="_blank">Dr. Ernest Osei</a>, where we were able to work on pipelines to integrate optimization solutions into real-world radiation therapy-planning tools. -->

<!--
