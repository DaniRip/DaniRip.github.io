### Current Role:<br><a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/people/danielle-ripsman/" target="_blank">Malone Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>

I work under <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/" target="_blank">Dr. Kimia Ghobadi</a> with affiliations across the <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)</a>, the <a href="https://hbhi.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Hopkins Business of Health Initiative (HBHI)</a> and the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a>.

I received my Ph.D. in Management Science at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/" target="_blank">Department of Management Sciences and Engineering</a> under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/h6mahmou" target="_blank">Dr. Houra Mahmoudzadeh</a> in 2024. I previously received my M.A.Sc. in the same department, under the same supervision in 2018. My B.A.Sc. was obtained at the University of Toronto in <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering</a> in 2016.

My research interests lie in tackling large-scale, data-driven societal problems, particularly in the field of healthcare  through optimization and efficient algorithms, and then bringing those solutions back out of theory to the end users and decision-makers. My primary application area has historically been radiation therapy treatment planning for cancer patients. I have had the pleasure of spending a work term at the <a href="https://www.wrhn.ca/" target="_blank">Waterloo Regional Health Network (WRHN)</a> Cancer Centre, under the supervision of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/contacts/ernest-osei" target="_blank">Dr. Ernest Osei</a>, where we were able to work on pipelines to integrate optimization solutions into radiation therapy-planning tools.

Whether it relates to public health, individual systems or fundamental algorithmic math, my emphasis is always on communication, illustration and teaching for the broader community.
