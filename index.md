**Current Role: **<a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/people/danielle-ripsman/" target="_blank">Malone Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>

I work under <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/" target"_blank">Dr. Kimia Ghobadi</a> and have affiliations with the <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/" target"_blank">Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)</a>, <a href="https://hbhi.jhu.edu/" target"_blank">Hopkins Business of Health Initiative (HBHI)</a> alongside the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a>.

I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/" target="_blank">Department of Management Sciences</a> in the **Faculty of Engineering** under **Dr. Houra Mahmoudzadeh**. I received my M.A.Sc. at the University of Waterloo in Management Sciences (2018) and my B.A.Sc. at the University of Toronto in Industrial Engineering (2016).

My research interests lie in improving the efficiency of solvers for large-scale optimization problems. My primary application area has been radiation therapy treatment planning for cancer patients. I have even had the pleasure of spending a work term at the Grand River Regional Cancer Centre, under the supervision of Dr. Ernest Osei.

From a methods perspective, I enjoy approaching problems in a visual fashion, while trying to maintain the optimality of solutions through smart algorithms. 

### Research Interests
* **Large-scale Optimization:** Improving solver efficiency for complex problems.
* **Radiation Therapy:** Treatment planning and clinical applications.
* **Visual Decision Analysis:** Navigating complex Pareto frontiers.
* **Algorithm Design:** Warm start generation heuristics and structural interpretation.
* **Optimization Theory:** Inverse optimization and optimization under uncertainty.
