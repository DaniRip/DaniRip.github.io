### Current Role: <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/people/danielle-ripsman/" target="_blank">Malone Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>

I work under <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/" target="_blank">Dr. Kimia Ghobadi</a> at Hopkins and have affiliations with the <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)</a>, <a href="https://hbhi.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Hopkins Business of Health Initiative (HBHI)</a> alongside the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a>.

I received my Ph.D. in Management Science at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/" target="_blank">Department of Management Sciences and Engineering</a> under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/h6mahmou" target="_blank">Dr. Houra Mahmoudzadeh</a> in 2024. I previously received my M.A.Sc. in 2018, under the same supervision, and my B.A.Sc. at the University of Toronto in Industrial Engineering (2016).

My research interests lie in tackling large-scale, data-driven societal problems, particularly in the field of healthcare  through optimization and efficient algorithms. My primary application area has been radiation therapy treatment planning for cancer patients. I have even had the pleasure of spending a work term at the <a href="https://www.wrhn.ca/" target="_blank">Waterloo Regional Health Network (WRHN)</a> Cancer Centre, under the supervision of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/contacts/ernest-osei" target="_blank">Dr. Ernest Osei</a>.

From a methods perspective, I enjoy approaching problems in a visual fashion, while trying to maintain the optimality of solutions through smart algorithms. 

### Research Interests
* **Large-scale Optimization:** Improving solver efficiency for complex problems.
* **Radiation Therapy:** Treatment planning and clinical applications.
* **Visual Decision Analysis:** Navigating complex Pareto frontiers.
* **Algorithm Design:** Warm start generation heuristics and structural interpretation.
* **Optimization Theory:** Inverse optimization and optimization under uncertainty.
